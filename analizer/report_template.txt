### What Users Like (UI/UX)

Present the most liked UX/UI features in the table below. Each row should have:

- **A clear theme name**

- **3 well-chosen review quotes**, paraphrased if needed
- **An estimated frequency**

| Theme                        | Summary of What Users Like                                                  | Supporting Quotes                                                                                                                | Est. Frequency              |

| ...                         | ...                                                                          | ...                                                                                                                               | ...                         |

### Recurring UX/UI Pain Points

Use a similar table to present recurring UX problems. Each pain point should include:

- **The theme or issue**
- **Short explanation of what the problem is**
- **3 actual or paraphrased complaints from users**
- **How frequently it shows up in reviews**

| Theme                        | Summary of User Complaint                                                  | Supporting Quotes                                                                                                                 | Est. Frequency              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| {{pain_point_1}}            | {{brief_summary_3}}                                                        | 1. "{{quote_7}}" (e.g., Review #19)<br>2. "{{quote_8}}" (e.g., Review #112)<br>3. "{{quote_9}}"                                   | Mentioned in ~{{y1}}% reviews |
| {{pain_point_2}}            | {{brief_summary_4}}                                                        | 1. "{{quote_10}}"<br>2. "{{quote_11}}"<br>3. "{{quote_12}}"                                                                        | Mentioned in ~{{y2}}% reviews |
| ...                         | ...                                                                         | ...                                                                                                                                | ...                         |

### Supporting Evidence  

**Top Positive Feedback**  
List a few of the strongest user quotes supporting the most liked features. Group them by theme.  
Example:
- **{{positive_theme_1}}**  
  > "{{user_quote_5}}" ({{refs}})  
  > "{{user_quote_6}}" ({{refs}})  

**Top Pain Points**  
Same for pain points:
- **{{pain_point_1}}**  
  > "{{user_quote_7}}" ({{refs}})  
  > "{{user_quote_8}}" ({{refs}})  

---

### Design Recommendations  
Give 5â€“6 prioritized UX suggestions addressing pain points. Use the format:

1. **{{recommendation_title}}**  
   - {{description}}

---

### Conclusion  
Summarize the key takeaway: why users value the app and what undermines that experience.  
Example:
> Users see {{app_name}} as {{positive_summary}}. But issues like {{pain_point_summary}} reduce satisfaction. Addressing these will significantly improve the UX.
