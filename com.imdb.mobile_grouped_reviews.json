Sometimes movies are rater PG13, like Titanic, but they have nudity. So you can find that out here, and avoid an awkward situation later. Also I find rating on IMDb to be accurate to my liking (except Disney and marvel are weighted, and skewed by fake ratings). It is great for researching movies and shows as well. Interesting goofs and trivia as well."
