## ❤️ What Users Like (Updated)  
- **Comprehensive movie/TV database & informational depth** (dominant, reinforced): Users consistently praise the extensive database for cast/crew info, trailers, release dates, ratings, and streaming availability. New mentions highlight its use for tracking content and discovering obscure titles.  
- **Watchlist functionality** (occasional, reinforced): Still valued for content tracking, though frequently overshadowed by navigation issues.  
- **Ratings & reviews system** (frequent, reinforced): Users heavily rely on ratings to gauge quality and discover content. New emphasis on ratings being "unbiased" and helpful for decision-making.  
- **Ease of information access for research** (reinforced): Quick access to actor filmographies and trivia is reiterated as a strength when functional.  
- **Trailer quality** (new theme, rare): Specifically praised for excellent trailer presentation quality.  

## ⚠️ Pain Points (Updated)  
- **Notification redirection failure** (dominant, reinforced): Persistent frustration with watchlist/trailer notifications opening the homepage instead of relevant content. Most cited issue across new reviews.  
- **Loss of scroll position in lists** (dominant, reinforced): Universal complaints about returning to the top of lists (watchlist, search results) after navigation, disrupting browsing flow.  
- **Intrusive/overloading ads** (dominant, reinforced): Ads consistently criticized for covering content, causing layout instability, and degrading readability (e.g., half-screen ads, motion distractions).  
- **Navigation inefficiencies** (frequent, reinforced):  
  - Back actions resetting list positions (reinforcement).  
  - App refreshes upon returning from multitasking, losing context (reinforcement).  
  - "Mark as watched" and other features buried behind multiple taps (new pattern).  
- **Performance issues** (frequent, reinforced): Slow loading, freezing ("Inconceivable!" errors), and lag during scrolling or interaction.  
- **User confusion about app purpose** (frequent, reinforced): Many users still expect streaming capabilities, leading to frustration over trailer-only content.  
- **Lack of feature parity with web** (frequent, reinforced): Strong demand for "mark as watched" buttons, saved sorting preferences, and list-sharing features missing in-app.  
- **Poor linkage between features** (occasional): Watchlist/actor alerts not integrating with filtering or search.  
- **UI design clutter and outdated aesthetics** (new theme): Complaints about non-intuitive layouts, "old" visuals, and excessive space for trailers/images compromising list management.
