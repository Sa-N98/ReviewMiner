It's easy to understand and the system of adding movies, choosing your favourite characters, and mostly seeing statistics of how much minutes you spend watching every week/month is interesting and fun. They even fixed some of the bugs I noticed earlier like the long load time and shows appearing in my favorites after I removed them. It has a lot of features for free that you'd have to pay for in other apps so I definitely recommend this app. Amazing!"

It's easy to understand and the system of adding movies, choosing your favourite characters, and mostly seeing statistics of how much minutes you spend watching every week/month is interesting and fun. They even fixed some of the bugs I noticed earlier like the long load time and shows appearing in my favorites after I removed them. It has a lot of features for free that you'd have to pay for in other apps so I definitely recommend this app. Amazing!"

It's easy to understand and the system of adding movies, choosing your favourite characters, and mostly seeing statistics of how much minutes you spend watching every week/month is interesting and fun. They even fixed some of the bugs I noticed earlier like the long load time and shows appearing in my favorites after I removed them. It has a lot of features for free that you'd have to pay for in other apps so I definitely recommend this app. Amazing!"
